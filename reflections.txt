Personal Reflection for Udacity review.
How long did you spend working on this project?
About an hour
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Creating, expanding the given specifications and implementing my own features
to the project.
What two additional features did you build? Why?
It is always good to collect more data about each business operation so that
they can be analyzed to see trends. Therefore, I have added ways to measure
returns and complaints to make our system more oriented towards the customers.
- Return system for keeping track of returns.
    - with time constraint of a week. The transactionreturn raises an error
        if the return didn't happen within a week of purchase
- Complaint class for keeping track of complaints
Where do you still have room to grow?
Right now, everything is saved in memory which wouldn't make sense in a real system
which needs to persist the data in a database like MySQL or MongoDB
